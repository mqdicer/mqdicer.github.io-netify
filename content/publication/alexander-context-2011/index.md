abstract: Whereas altruism drives the evolution of human cooperation, ethno- religious
  diversity has been considered to obstruct it, leading to poverty, corruption, and
  war. We argue that current research has failed to properly account for the institutional
  environment and how it affects the role diversity plays. The emergence of thriving,
  diverse communities throughout human history suggests that diversity does not always
  lead to cooperation breakdown. We conducted experiments in Mostar, Bosnia- Herzegovina
  with Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks at a critical historic moment in the city's
  postwar history. Using a public goods game, we found that the ability to sanction
  is key to achieving cooperation in ethno-religiously diverse groups, but that sanctions
  succeed only in integrated institutional environments and fail in segregated ones.
  Hence, we show experimentally for the first time in a real-life setting that institutions
  of integration can unleash human altruism and restore cooperation in the presence
  of diversity.
