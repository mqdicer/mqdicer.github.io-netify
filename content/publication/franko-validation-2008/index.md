abstract: 'PURPOSE: Circumduction of the wrist consists of a circular motion combining
  flexion, extension, and radioulnar deviation without simultaneous supination or
  pronation of the forearm. This pattern of flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation
  coupling is vital in common tasks; however, its evaluation in hand clinics is limited
  by the availability and ease of current tools. We present the construct, criterion,
  test-retest, and inter-rater validity of a new circumduction measurement device.
  METHODS: Splint volunteers (n = 42) and hand clinic patients (n = 51) were studied
  to assess different aspects of validity and reliability for the circumduction jig.
  Known-group validation was used to assess construct validity and demonstrate the
  ability of the device to differentiate between patients with lesser or greater circumduction
  values. Criterion validity was demonstrated by comparing the circumduction measures
  of the device to flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation. Test-retest
  reliability was established by comparing the results of repeated circumduction measures
  for the hand clinic patients by 2 blinded, independent researchers, and inter-rater
  reliability was determined by evaluating the correlation in circumduction measures
  taken on the same patient by different blinded, independent researchers. RESULTS:
  Circumduction measurements significantly decreased (test for trend, p textless .01)
  across the 3 different treatments that represented progressively reduced range of
  motion, establishing construct validity of the device. Flexion, extension, and radioulnar
  deviation all correlated significantly with circumduction; the correlation values
  ranged from 0.46 to 0.82 (p textless .01) among all subjects (93 subjects, 228 measurements).
  Intra-rater reliability was 0.98 (p textless .01) for both evaluators, and inter-rater
  reliability was 0.94 (p textless .01). CONCLUSIONS: The present validation study
  demonstrated criterion, construct, test- retest, and inter-rater reliability for
  a newly designed circumduction measurement device.'
