abstract: Genetic correlation between mates at specific loci can greatly alter the
  evolutionary trajectory of a species. Genetic assortative mating has been documented
  in humans, but its existence beyond population stratification (shared ancestry)
  has been a matter of controversy. Here, we develop a method to measure assortative
  mating across the genome at 1,044,854 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), controlling
  for population stratification and cohort-specific cryptic relatedness. Using data
  on 1683 human couples from two data sources, we find evidence for both assortative
  and disassortative mating at specific, discernible loci throughout the entire genome.
  Then, using the composite of multiple signals (CMS) score, we also show that the
  group of SNPs exhibiting the most assortativity has been under stronger recent positive
  selection. Simulations using realistic inputs confirm that assortative mating might
  indeed affect changes in allele frequency over time. These results suggest that
  genetic assortative mating may be speeding up evolution in humans.
