abstract: "This study validates a novel, modern wrist and hand functional assessment:\
  \ the Modern Activity Subjective Survey of 2007 (MASS07). In total, 326 patients\
  \ visiting an academic tertiary-care orthopaedic hand clinic (April 2006-April 2007)\
  \ were recruited to complete the MASS07 questionnaire, Disabilities of the Arm,\
  \ Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE)\
  \ to assess construct validity, criterion validity and test-retest reliability of\
  \ the MASS07. MASS07 correlated strongly with both PRWE (0.81) and DASH (0.85) even\
  \ when adjusted for age, sex and history of hand problems (Ptextless0.001). MASS07\
  \ scores compared for 42 patients with repeated visits indicated no statistically\
  \ significant difference between MASS07 scores at the patients' first and second\
  \ clinic visit. We conclude that the newly constructed MASS07 instrument is valid\
  \ and reliable with respect to the outpatient population with a wide spectrum of\
  \ hand and wrist pathologies for fast and effective assessment of patient-reported\
  \ hand function during modern daily activities."
