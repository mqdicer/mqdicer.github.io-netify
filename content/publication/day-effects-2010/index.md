abstract: "BACKGROUND: Workers' Compensation differs from standard insurance, and\
  \ it is unclear how or if Workers' Compensation insurance influences the diagnosis\
  \ and treatment of hand and wrist disorders. The aim of this study was to compare\
  \ the diagnosis and course of treatment of hand disorders between patients with\
  \ Workers' Compensation insurance and patients with standard insurance. METHODS:\
  \ The complete medical records of patients who visited an academic orthopaedic hand\
  \ clinic between January 2005 and January 2007 were reviewed, and information on\
  \ patient history, utilization of diagnostic tests, diagnosis, surgery, and wait-\
  \ time to surgery was collected. Patients with Workers' Compensation insurance and\
  \ those with other, third-party coverage were analyzed and compared. Patients without\
  \ insurance were excluded from this study. RESULTS: 1413 patients (representing\
  \ 2121 diagnoses) were included in the study. One hundred and sixteen patients (8%)\
  \ had Workers' Compensation insurance and 1297 patients (92%) had standard insurance.\
  \ Patients with Workers' Compensation insurance were younger than patients with\
  \ standard insurance (mean age, forty-three years compared with fifty years, respectively;\
  \ p textless 0.05) and were also more likely to be male (50% compared with 40%,\
  \ respectively; p = 0.04). Generally, Workers' Compensation patients more often\
  \ had neurological conditions (p textless 0.01), but there was no significant difference\
  \ in the most common diagnoses between the two groups. Patients with Workers' Compensation\
  \ underwent surgery slightly more often than did patients with standard insurance\
  \ (44% compared with 35%, respectively; p = 0.07) and had a higher average number\
  \ of visits before undergoing surgery (2.3 visits compared with 1.2 visits, respectively;\
  \ p textless 0.05). Twenty-three (45%) of the fifty-one patients with Workers' Compensation\
  \ insurance who received a diagnosis indicating the need for surgery underwent surgery\
  \ after the first visit, compared with 316 (69%) of 458 patients with standard insurance\
  \ (p textless 0.05). Patients with Workers' Compensation insurance were more likely\
  \ than patients with standard insurance to undergo electrodiagnostic testing (26%\
  \ compared with 15%, respectively; p textless 0.01) or magnetic resonance imaging\
  \ (16% compared with 9%, respectively; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients\
  \ receiving standard insurance, patients receiving Workers' Compensation insurance\
  \ have a greater number of clinic visits before undergoing surgery and receive more\
  \ diagnostic testing. More research is needed to explore these differences and their\
  \ potential clinical and economic consequences."
