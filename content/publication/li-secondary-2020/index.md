abstract: "BACKGROUND: Gonorrhea and chlamydia are common among Chinese men who have\
  \ sex with men (MSM), but testing rates are low. We developed a pay-it- forward\
  \ program where men receive a free gonorrhea/chlamydia test and can then donate\
  \ toward future participants' tests. This study aims to investigate drivers of testing\
  \ uptake and donation using a mixed methods approach. METHODS: We used a sequential\
  \ explanatory design to explore drivers of testing uptake and donation unique to\
  \ pay-it-forward through a quantitative cross-sectional survey and a qualitative\
  \ thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. We collected data on sociodemographics\
  \ and perceived benefits of pay-it-forward among men offered the pay-it-forward\
  \ interventionand analyzed testing uptake and donations using descriptive statistics\
  \ and logistic regression. We then conducted 30 semistructured interviews with men\
  \ and coded interview data to identify themes. RESULTS: Three hundred and one MSM\
  \ were offered pay-it-forward and 55% (165/301) received gonorrhea/chlamydia testing.\
  \ Ninety-one percent (150 of 165) donated any amount with a mean of 58.31 +/- 53.39\
  \ RMB (US $8.61 +/- 7.88), or 39% of the standard price of gonorrhea/chlamydia testing.\
  \ Getting tested was not associated with income, but donations were higher in the\
  \ highest income bracket (adjusted odds ratio, 7.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-31.52).\
  \ Fifty-eight percent (94 of 162) selected \\\"more MSM can get tested,\\\" and\
  \ 54% (88 of 162) selected \\\"I can help someone else\\\" as benefits of pay-it-forward.\
  \ Qualitative themes for drivers of testing and donation included flexible pricing,\
  \ generosity and reciprocity, and MSM community identity. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative\
  \ and qualitative results suggest that this pay-it-forward program may increase\
  \ gonorrhea/chlamydia testing by reducing cost barriers, leveraging generosity and\
  \ reciprocity, and mobilizing community altruism."
