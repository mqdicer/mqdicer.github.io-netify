abstract: "OBJECTIVE: This was an open-label study to asses the association of changes\
  \ in hemoglobin with changes in health related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients\
  \ treated with darbepoetin alfa. METHODS: Originally, 81 chronic kidney disease\
  \ (CKD) patients not on dialysis and naive to erythropoiesis stimulating agents\
  \ (ESA) were randomly assigned into two open-label groups (3 : 1). As a majority\
  \ of control group patients opted out of control status, this study reports on the\
  \ single arm study analysis that was performed on the 48 patients who received the\
  \ drug through week 16. Sixty-two patients received once-weekly darbepoetin alfa\
  \ in addition to conservative management for CKD. Instruments that measured general\
  \ (SF-36, FACTanemia, FACT-fatigue, ADL and IADL) and disease specific (KDQOL) HRQOL\
  \ domains were administered at baseline and after 8, 16, and 24 weeks. RESULTS:\
  \ Compared to baseline values, mean HRQOL subscales were significantly improved\
  \ in the treatment group at 16 weeks (p textless 0.05 for SF-36 physical function;\
  \ p textless 0.001 for SF-36 vitality, FACT anemia and FACT fatigue scales). At\
  \ week 16, the SF-36 mean increase for 48 treatment patients in the Vitality Subscale\
  \ Score was 14.9 (SD 3.2) and the mean increase in the KDQOL Burden of Kidney Disease\
  \ Subscale was 5.5 (SD 3.3). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a statistically\
  \ significant association (p textless 0.05) between hemoglobin levels and higher\
  \ HRQOL scores on several physical function, energy and fatigue scales. CONCLUSION:\
  \ Improvements in hemoglobin in CKD patients not on dialysis were associated with\
  \ statistically significant (p textless 0.05), clinically meaningful (textgreater\
  \ 5 points) HRQOL improvements on scales measuring physical activity, vitality and\
  \ fatigue. Our study did not show an association between increased hemoglobin levels\
  \ and other aspects of HRQOL, such as those relating to emotional status, sexual\
  \ activity or cognition. The interpretation of our results is limited by the lack\
  \ of a control arm to assess whether conservative therapy for CKD, in the absence\
  \ of ESA administration, would have a comparable effect on patients' HRQOL scores.\
  \ Further research needs to examine whether other aspects of HRQOL improve with\
  \ anemia treatment, in the same way as those aspects of HRQOL more closely related\
  \ to physical activity and fatigue."
