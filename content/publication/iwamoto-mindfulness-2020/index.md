abstract: Clinical evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation reduces anxiety,
  depression, and stress, and improves emotion regulation due to modulation of activity
  in neural substrates linked to the regulation of emotions and social preferences.
  However, less was known about whether mindfulness meditation might alter pro-social
  behavior. Here we examined whether mindfulness meditation activates human altruism,
  a component of social cooperation. Using a simple donation game, which is a real-world
  version of the Dictator's Game, we randomly assigned 326 subjects to a mindfulness
  meditation online session or control and measured their willingness to donate a
  portion of their payment for participation as a charitable donation. Subjects who
  underwent the meditation treatment donated at a 2.61 times higher rate than the
  control (p = 0.005), after controlling for socio-demographics. We also found a larger
  treatment effect of meditation among those who did not go to college (p textless
  0.001) and those who were under 25 years of age (p textless 0.001), with both subject
  groups contributing virtually nothing in the control condition. Our results imply
  high context modularity of human altruism and the development of intervention approaches
  including mindfulness meditation to increase social cooperation, especially among
  subjects with low baseline willingness to contribute.
