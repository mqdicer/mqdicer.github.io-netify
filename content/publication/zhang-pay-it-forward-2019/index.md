abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing rates are poor among Chinese
  men who have sex with men (MSM). A quasi-experimental study suggested that a pay-it-forward
  strategy increased dual gonorrhea/chlamydia testing among MSM. Pay-it-forward offers
  an individual a gift (e.g., a free test) and then asks the same person if they would
  like to give a gift to another person. This article reports the protocol of a randomized
  controlled trial to evaluate dual gonorrhea/chlamydia test uptake and other outcomes
  among MSM in three arms - a pay-it-forward arm, a pay- what-you-want arm, and a
  standard of care arm. METHODS: Three hundred MSM will be recruited at three HIV
  testing sites in Guangzhou and Beijing. Testing sites include two hospital-based
  MSM sexually transmitted diseases clinics and one MSM community-based organization.
  Eligible participants will be born biologically male, aged 16 years or older, reporting
  previous anal sex with another man, having never participated in the pay-it-forward
  program, without previous gonorrhea and chlamydia testing in the past 12 months,
  and residing in China. Following a cluster randomized design, every cluster of ten
  participants will be randomly allocated into one of three arms: (1) a pay-it-forward
  arm in which men are offered free gonorrhea and chlamydia testing and then asked
  whether they would like to donate (\"pay it forward\") toward testing for future
  testers; (2) a pay-what-you-want arm in which men are offered free testing and told
  to decide how much to pay after receiving the test; (3) a standard of care arm in
  which men can pay the full price for dual gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. The
  primary outcome is dual gonorrhoea/chlamydia testing as verified by administrative
  records. Secondary outcomes include incremental cost per test, incremental cost
  per diagnosis, community connectedness, and social cohesion. Primary outcome will
  be calculated for each arm using intention-to-treat and compared using one-sided
  95% confidence intervals with a margin of 20% increase defined as superiority. DISCUSSION:
  This study will examine the pay-it-forward strategy in comparison to the standard
  of care in improving test uptake for gonorrhea and chlamydia. We will leverage the
  cluster randomized controlled trial to provide scientific evidence on the potential
  effect of pay-it-forward. Findings from this study will shed light on novel intervention
  methods for increasing preventive health service utilization and innovate ways to
  finance it among communities. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03741725
