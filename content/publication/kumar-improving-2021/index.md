abstract: We assessed if same-sex sexual behavior disclosure of index men who have
  sex with men (MSM) was related to number of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits requested
  by index participants, and number of test results successfully uploaded by alters
  in a network-based HIVST intervention. Index participants are men who accessed and
  distributed HIVST kits and alters are index's social contacts who received kits.
  We analyzed treatment arm data [N = 106, mean age = 27 (SD = 5.3)] of an intervention
  conducted among MSM in Guangzhou, China, May 2019-December 2019. Index MSM who disclosed
  sexual behavior to their family tended to request more kits [adjusted incidence
  rate ratio (aIRR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.06, 1.90, p textless .05]. Index men who disclosed
  sexual behavior to their family (aIRR 2.47, 95% CI 1.17, 5.24, p textless .05) tended
  to yield an increase in number of alter test results uploaded. Findings have implications
  for the development of network-based interventions for key populations.
