 abstract = {We assessed if same-sex sexual behavior disclosure of index men who have sex with men (MSM) was related to number of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits requested by index participants, and number of test results successfully uploaded by alters in a network-based HIVST intervention. Index participants are men who accessed and distributed HIVST kits and alters are index's social contacts who received kits. We analyzed treatment arm data [N = 106, mean age = 27 (SD = 5.3)] of an intervention conducted among MSM in Guangzhou, China, May 2019-December 2019. Index MSM who disclosed sexual behavior to their family tended to request more kits [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.06, 1.90, p \textless .05]. Index men who disclosed sexual behavior to their family (aIRR 2.47, 95% CI 1.17, 5.24, p \textless .05) tended to yield an increase in number of alter test results uploaded. Findings have implications for the development of network-based interventions for key populations.},
