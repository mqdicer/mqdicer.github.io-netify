abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) globally have a high burden
  of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs). MSM do not frequently receive
  rectal STI testing because of several barriers, such as not being out (disclosure
  of sexual behavior). We evaluate whether Chinese MSM select an STI test (rectal
  vs urethral) appropriate for their sexual behavior (insertive and/or receptive),
  and the interactions with being out. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data
  from a cross sectional MSM survey conducted at a multisite randomized controlled
  trial (RCT) (December 2018 to January 2019) around uptake of gonorrhea and chlamydia
  testing among Chinese MSM (N = 431). We collected socio demographics, relevant medical
  and sexual history, and disclosure of sexual behavior (outness). We estimated the
  decision to test and test choice, and the extent to which disclosure plays a role
  in decision making. RESULTS: Among 431 MSM, mean age was 28 years (SD = 7.10) and
  65% were out to someone. MSM who indicated versatile sexual behavior and were out
  to someone had a 26.8% (95%CI = 6.1, 47.5) increased likelihood for selecting the
  rectal test vs the ure thral test, compared to those versatile and not out. Versatile
  MSM out to their health provider outside of the study context had a 29.4% (95%CI
  = 6.3, 52.6) greater likelihood for selecting the rectal STI test vs the urethral
  test, compared to versatile MSM not out to their health provider. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual
  behavior and outness may affect gonorrhea and chlamydia testing provision. Apart
  from clinicians, community based efforts may reduce stigma based barriers to testing.'
